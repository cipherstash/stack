Fix CJS consumers crashing with `Must use import to load ES Module: .../uuid/dist-node/index.js`. The `uuid` package is pure ESM and has no CJS entry point, so the CJS build of `@cipherstash/stack` could not `require()` it at runtime. `uuid` is now bundled into the CJS output (the ESM build is unchanged).

Expose `EncryptedTable.columnBuilders` as a public, read-only field so consumers can iterate the typed column-builder map of an encrypted table without reaching into the built `TableDefinition` (`schema.build().columns`) or the private internal.
