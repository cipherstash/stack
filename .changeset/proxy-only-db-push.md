`stash db push` is no longer included by default in `stash plan` / `stash impl` agent prompts or the wizard's post-agent step. SDK users (Drizzle, Supabase, plain PostgreSQL) no longer see `stash db push` baked into their rollout/cutover walkthroughs — the encryption config lives in app code, so the database doesn't need a copy.

Pass `--proxy` to `stash init` (or answer the new interactive prompt) if you query encrypted data via [CipherStash Proxy](https://github.com/cipherstash/proxy). The choice is persisted to `.cipherstash/context.json` as `usesProxy` and is honoured by `stash plan`, `stash impl`, and the wizard's post-agent step. Existing `.cipherstash/context.json` files without the field default to SDK-only.

Known gap: `stash encrypt cutover` currently requires a pending EQL config registered via `stash db push`, so SDK-only users running the migrate-existing-column flow will hit a "No pending EQL configuration" error from cutover. Workaround: run `stash db push` once before `stash encrypt cutover`. Decoupling cutover from EQL config for SDK-only users is tracked as a follow-up to [#447](https://github.com/cipherstash/stack/issues/447).
