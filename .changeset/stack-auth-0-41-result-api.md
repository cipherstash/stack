Bump `@cipherstash/auth` (and its per-platform native bindings) from `0.40.0` to `0.41.0`, and migrate to its new `Result`-returning API.

**What changed in `@cipherstash/auth` `0.41`.** Every fallible auth operation now returns a `@byteslice/result` `Result<T, AuthFailure>` (`{ data }` on success, `{ failure }` on error) instead of throwing. This covers strategy construction (`AccessKeyStrategy.create`, `OidcFederationStrategy.create`, `AutoStrategy.detect`, `DeviceSessionStrategy.fromProfile`), `getToken()`, and the device-code flow (`beginDeviceCodeFlow`, `pollForToken`, `openInBrowser`, `bindClientDevice`). Consumers now write `if (result.failure) …` and read `result.data` rather than `try/catch`. The `AuthError` type was renamed to **`AuthFailure`** — a discriminated union keyed by `type` (`"NOT_AUTHENTICATED"`, `"WORKSPACE_MISMATCH"`, …), replacing the old `error.code` string.

**`@cipherstash/stack` (breaking type surface).**

- **`AuthError` is renamed to `AuthFailure`** in the public re-exports from `@cipherstash/stack`. `AuthErrorCode` and `TokenResult` are unchanged. Anyone importing `AuthError` from `@cipherstash/stack` must switch to `AuthFailure`.
- The WASM-inline access-key path (`resolveStrategy`, used by `@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline`'s `Encryption()`) now unwraps the `Result` from `AccessKeyStrategy.create`. A construction failure (e.g. an invalid CRN or access key) throws a descriptive `[encryption]` error naming the `AuthFailure.type` instead of surfacing the raw auth error.
- Bump `@cipherstash/protect-ffi` from `0.27.0` to `0.28.0`. auth `0.41`'s `getToken()` returns the token inside a `Result` envelope; protect-ffi `0.28` unwraps it (`.data.token`) inside its WASM `newClient`, whereas `0.27` read `.token` off the envelope and got `undefined` — which failed the WASM encrypt/decrypt round-trip with `token field is not a string`. `0.28` is the floor for the WASM path under auth `0.41`.

**`stash` (CLI) and `@cipherstash/wizard`.** Internal auth call sites (`stash auth login`, device binding, `init` auth check, and the wizard's token acquisition / prerequisite check) were updated to unwrap `Result` and branch on `failure.type`. Behaviour is preserved — auth failures still surface the same way to end users; no CLI/wizard API changed.
